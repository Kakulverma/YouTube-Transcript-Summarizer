# YouTube-Transcript-Summarizer
Project extracts and summarizes YouTube video transcripts using youtube_transcript_api and Hugging Face's transformers library. The script fetches the transcript of a YouTube video, then uses a pre-trained summarization model to condense the text into a shorter summary. This allows for quick overviews of video content without needing to watch the entire video.

Features:
Fetches YouTube video transcripts.
Summarizes large transcripts using NLP models.
Breaks down long transcripts into manageable chunks for summarization.

Requirements:
